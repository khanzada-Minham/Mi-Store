            <h1>Shipping policy</h1>
            <h2>SHIPPING & CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
            <p>Which locations do you deliver to?

               <div> We deliver all over Pakistan.</div>
                
                What are your delivery times?
                
                Packages are delivered between 09:00 -19:00 from Monday to Saturday. There are no deliveries on Sunday and on public holidays.
                
                How long would it take for me to receive my order?
                
                We would make every effort to deliver your order within 5-7 business days.
                
                Please note that Mi Pakistan is not liable for any shipping delays, or loss of any kind resulting from unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances, such as: recipient was unavailable or un-contactable; incorrectly addressed orders; weather conditions and so on. We will try our best to notify customers of the delay and estimated delivery date in such situations.
                
                Why is my delivery delayed if I choose the following payment methods: (Bank Alfalah, COD, Keenu)
                
                To ensure fool proof and secure transactions, these payment gateways hold deliveries for 24 hours. As soon as we get a green signal from them we dispatch the products immediately.
                
                Do you offer free shipping?
                No due to increase in fuel prices, all orders are charged Rs.190 delivery cost.

                Is it necessary for me to provide identification when I receive the package?

                Yes, provision of identification, such as ID card number, and signature (as per ID card) on courier sheet are a must when receiving paid orders. In case of COD orders identification is not required though customer may have to sign the courier sheet. Please note that this information is for the security of our customers. With this information we ensure that rightful owner received the product.

                What should I do when I receive my delivery?

                All Mi packages are perfectly sealed at the warehouse before they are shipped to you. Upon receipt, please check the external condition of the package/box to see if there are signs of damage, or if the package has been opened during transit. We request you not to sign and accept if you are concerned about the condition of the shipment. Instead, hand the package back to the courier and we will replace the items to you within few days.

                Customers are advised to make video while unwrapping and unboxing their product from delivery packaging. This video will be used as a proof incase customer receives damaged goods or incomplete items.

                Customers may claim refund if they receive damaged goods however they must provide video proof of this.

                If video proof is not provided or video is made after the product has been unboxed then customer will not be entitled to a refund.

                If you find that the product in the box is tampered or missing when you open the package, please contact Mi Pakistan Customer Service at 0311-111-1050 within 24 hours of receiving the shipment.

                Can I modify my delivery address?

                Once the order has been placed, you can not change the delivery address. You have to cancel the order and re-order the product with the correct address. The payments, if you have already made, will be refunded to you as per refund terms and conditions.

                What can I do if the package was delivered to the wrong person?

                Please contact our delivery partners or Mi Pakistan customer service to get help on such issues.
